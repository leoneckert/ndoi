        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Nomadic Department of the Interior (NDOI) is a research collective that seeks to address, in films, websites, and publications, the conflicting interests between stewardship of lands & extraction of material and cultural resources. Our research investigates technological systems against the backdrop of geological, ecological, human history.</p>
        <p>Our current project is about the western Chinese province of Guizhou. This is part of a larger, long-term body of work about the collision of technology and rural places.</p>
        <p>Our <a href="#members">members</a> are currently based in China and Taiwan.</p>
